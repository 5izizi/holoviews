About Us
========

HoloViews is an `open-source <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_ Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple.  With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.

If you have any questions or usage issues visit the `HoloViews Discourse <https://discourse.holoviz.org/c/holoviews/>`_ site. If you are interested in contributing to HoloViews development to help address some of the `open issues <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/issues>`_.

HoloViews is supported and maintained by `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_.
