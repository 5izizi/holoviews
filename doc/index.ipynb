      "This functionality is designed to complement the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook/) interface.  As shown in the [Tutorials](Tutorials/), the notebook allows you to interleave code, output, and graphics easily.  With HoloViews, you can just put a minimum of code in the notebook (typically one or two lines per subfigure), specifying what you would like to see rather than the details of how it should be plotted.  This makes the IPython Notebook a practical solution for both exploratory research (since viewing nearly any chunk of data just takes a line or two of code) and for long-term reproducibility of the work (because both the code and the resulting figure are preserved in the notebook file forever).  See the [Tutorials](Tutorials/) for detailed examples, and then start enjoying working with your data!"
