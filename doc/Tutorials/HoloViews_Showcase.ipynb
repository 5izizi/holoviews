      "* Preserve your raw data while engaging in rapid, interactive exploratory analysis.\n",
      "* Build complex, composite visualizations that are easily interactively customized at any time.\n",
      "* Short, declarative style enables all necessary code to be presented, enabling your workflow is fully reproducibile.\n",
      "* Select, slice or transform only the relevant data that is currently of interest.\n",
      "* Store your raw data as holoviews objects via pickling.\n",
      "* Strong support for the IPython Notebook including tab-completion throughout and powerful magics.\n",
      "* Seamless interaction with Pandas Dataframes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using IPython notebook is only the first step towards an interactive, exploratory workflow using Python's rich ecosystem of data analysis tools. Holoviews will greatly improve your productivity, requiring fewer lines of code, allowing you to spend more time to explore your data instead of writing code to visualize and process it."
