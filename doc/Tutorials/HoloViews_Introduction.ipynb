For instance, if you wrap a 2D numpy array in a ``Matrix`` it will be displayed with a colormap, a color image in an ``RGB`` component will be suitably presented in color, a ``Curve`` will be presented a curve on an axis and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* ***Dimensions of your data***. The key dimension(s) describe what dimensions your data can be indexed by. The value dimension(s) describe what the resulting indexed data represents. A ``Dimension`` have names, types, ranges and units. This information allows HoloViews to rescale and label axes and allows HoloViews be smart in how it processes your data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* ***The multi-dimensional space in which your data resides***. This may be space as we normally think of it (in X, Y and Z coordinates). It may be the spatial position of one component relative to another. Or it may be an entirely abstract space such as a parameter space.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* ***How your data relates to other data***. In short how your data is organized. If you have a collection of points that was computed from an image, you can overlay your points over the image. As a result you have something that both displays sensibly and is grouped together in a semantically meaningful way.\n",

      "By requiring little or no additional information ([``Component``](./HoloViews_Components.ipynb) type) HoloViews stays out your way when initially exploring your data, offering immediate feedback with with reasonable default visualizations. As your data becomes more complex and your research progresses, you may offer more useful metadata so that HoloViews which will automatically improve your displayed figures accordingly.\n",
