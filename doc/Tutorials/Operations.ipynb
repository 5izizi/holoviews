    "HoloViews objects provide a convenient way of wrapping your data along with some metadata for exploration and visualization. In addition to the Elements and containers, HoloViews also provides so called ``Operations``, which can transform objects in custom ways allowing the user to build data processing pipelines. Examples of such operations are ``histogram``, ``rolling``, ``datashade`` or ``decimate``, which apply some computation on certain types of Element and return a new Element with the transformed data.\n",

    "The most common and useful kind of operations are the ``ElementOperation`` classes, which transform one Element or Overlay of Elements returning a new and transformed Element. All operations are so called ``ParameterizedFunction`` objects, which means that they allow defining parameters using the ``param`` library, providing validation for all parameters that control how the operation is applied. This also means we can change the parameters of an operation at the class-level, instance-level and when we call the operation. Let's start by having a look at the ``histogram`` operation. Just as for all other HoloViews objects we can inspect the ``histogram`` operation with the ``hv.help`` function:"

As a simple example we can create an ``BoxWhisker`` Element containing samples from a normal distribution, and then apply the ``histogram`` operation to those samples in two ways: 1) by creating an instance on which we will change the ``num_bins`` and 2) by passing ``bin_range`` directly to the call of the operation:"
