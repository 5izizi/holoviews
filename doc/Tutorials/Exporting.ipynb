When used with IPython Notebook, HoloViews also helps you establish a fully reproducible scientific or engineering workflow for generating reports or publications.  That is, HoloViews can create and export figures that feed directly into your papers or web pages, along with records of how those figures were generated, providing a clear chain of provenance for your results.  This tutorial will describe how to export your results in a way that preserves the information about how those results were generated."

They can also be edited using Inkscape or other vector drawing programs to move graphical elements around, add arbitrary text, etc., if you need to make final tweaks before using the figures in a document.
