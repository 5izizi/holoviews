      "HoloViews is designed to be both highly customizable, allowing you to control how your visualizations appear, but also to enforce a strong separation between your data (with semantically associated metadata, like type and label information) and any options related purely to visualization.  This separation allows HoloViews objects to be generated easily by external programs, without giving them a dependency on any plotting or windowing libraries.  It also helps make it completely clear which parts of your code deal with the actual data, and which are just about displaying it nicely.\n",
