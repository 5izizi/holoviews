# Feature request

If you are proposing a feature, it's great if you can include as much
of the following as possible, but we are always happy to discuss even
brief feature requests to flesh them out. (We may already want and
have thought about how to implement the feature you are proposing!)

  * Motivation - what are you trying to enable? can you already do it,
    but in an awkward way? etc

  * Proposed outline of an implementation

  * ...


# Bug report

Things to consider including:

  * What went wrong?

## Errors and warnings

If relevant, please include:

  * Any messages/tracebacks in your browser's developer tools console.
